        <h2>Introduction to Automation</h2>
        <p>
          Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks without
          human intervention. It involves the creation of systems and processes
          that can operate automatically based on predefined instructions. In
          today's digital era, automation plays a crucial role across various
          industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to finance and
          logistics. The goal of automation is to streamline workflows, reduce
          manual effort, and improve overall efficiency and accuracy. It
          encompasses technologies like robotics, artificial intelligence (AI),
          machine learning, and robotic process automation (RPA). Businesses
          adopt automation to increase productivity, lower operational costs,
          and enhance the quality and speed of services. Automation is also
          transforming the way we work, enabling organizations to focus on
          strategic initiatives while repetitive tasks are handled by automated
          systems. As technology continues to advance, automation will play an
          increasingly vital role in shaping the future of work and business
          processes.
